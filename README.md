Social Media Network Analysis in R
This analysis used the igraph library of R.
Consider two users on any social media platform- A and B.
So, A and B are said to be nodes(n) and their connection is showed by arrows(edges). Degree refers to the number of connections for each node.
This way, the network of social media users can be analysed.

For the dataset attached, a graphical analysis of the network of 290 social media users over a particular platform.
For analysis, firstly a histogram of node degree is made, which shows that there are some nodes which have very high connections, but there are many nodes with very few connections.
For further analysis, various network diagrams have been made to understand the network, and the nodes are set to be bigger or smaller according to their degree.
Further, the analysis of Hubs(outgoing links) and Authorities(incoming links) is done.
Community detection is also done to see the density of connections. We can study different groups, and within groups there are dense as well as sparce connections.
